## Description

The purpose of this laboratory work is to write a somewhat realistic simulation of how a restaurant works like.

## Current Implementation

* Initialising 2 web-servers.
* Establish http communication between them
* Initial logic of generating random orders and sending that orders to kitchen and logic of receiving the orders that should be served from kitchen.
* Initial logic of preparing foods at kitchen should be implemented. Just logic of having multiple threads picking up orders, preparing them all and returning them.
* Configuration of docker containers communication
* Added logic for checking if received order is the same as requested, logic of serving foods to tables and updating the table_states
* Added logic for cooking foods according to the cooks 'rank' and fixed issues related to finishing orders only after all items are cooked
* Handling cooks multitasking according to their proficiency
* Add all atributes necessary for orders when sending and receiving
* Calculating Order_total_preparing_time and defining the rating of the restaurant according to the feedbacks
* The cooking-aparatus logic 
* The prioritising ordering

## Docker

1.Create docker image with name (<name1>) for kitchen server
~~~
docker build --tag <name1> .
~~~
2.Create docker communication network (<name2>) for dinning hall server and kitchen server to communicate on
~~~
docker network create <name2>
~~~
3.Create docker container for kitchen server and run on created network
~~~
docker run -d --net name2 --name name1 name1
~~~

## Technologies
