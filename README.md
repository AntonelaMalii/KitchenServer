* Initialising 2 web-servers.
* Establish http communication between them
* Initial logic of generating random orders and sending that orders to kitchen and logic of receiving the orders that should be served from kitchen.
* Initial logic of preparing foods at kitchen should be implemented. Just logic of having multiple threads picking up orders, preparing them all and returning them.
* Configuration of docker containers communication
##Docker
1.Create docker image with name (<name1>) for kitchen server
~~~
docker build --tag <name1> 
~~~
2.Create docker communication network (<name2>) for dinning hall server and kitchen server to communicate on
~~~
docker network create <name2>
~~~
3.Create docker container for kitchen server and run on created network
~~~
docker run -d --net name2 --name name1 name1
~~~
## Technologies
* IDE : PyCharm
* Programming language : Python 3.9
